<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>It's funny that I am writing an about me, as I dont particually like to write about myself</p>

<p>Also, when I have to do it on the spot, like this, it usually ends up pretty boring. Like this.</p>

<p>But the point to this all is that my name is Fleur and I really do not like writing "about me's" and mosquitos. 
  I do like pretty much anything else. And that is the end of my about me!
