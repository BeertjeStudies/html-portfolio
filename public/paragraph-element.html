 In this section, we have learned how to use paragraphs
 It was quite easy to do and secretly I knew this already
 But it doesnt make this course less enjoyable. 
 Actually, I got into it right from the start
</p>

 I decided to put a goal for myself, I have been creating websites on and off for the past 15 years or so.
 Even professionally at a company called Flexper. I got hired right after they were the subject of a television show where the host told them they were doing badly.
 It costs them many many customers. They decided not to sign new customers, but to keep their current customers happy, until the end.

<p>
 We did manage to keep them happy till the end. After that I got into jewelry, but thats a whole different story. 
 Back to the goal, right? Well, the goal is to finish this all within the next 3 weeks. Hopefully 10 days, but that seems a bit undoable. 
 Oh, and of course a goal is to shape things like this up.
